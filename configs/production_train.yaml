# Production Model Training Configuration
#
# Trains on ALL 6 labeled images for maximum data utilization.
# Designed for production deployment in human-in-the-loop annotation workflow.
#
# Note: Uses same manifest for train and val since we're training on all available data.
# The model will be validated through human review during inference.

# Data manifests
data:
  train_manifest: data/splits/all.csv
  val_manifest: data/splits/all.csv  # Same as train - using all data
  data_root: data  # Root directory for resolving relative paths in manifests
