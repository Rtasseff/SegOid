# Phase 6: Cross-validation configuration
#
# Leave-one-out cross-validation for the 6 labeled images.
# This provides robust performance estimates and trains models that have seen
# all available data (5/6 images per fold).

# Cross-validation strategy
cv:
  strategy: leave_one_out  # Options: leave_one_out, k_fold
  source_manifest: data/splits/all.csv  # Manifest with all labeled images
  seed: 42
  # n_folds: 5  # Only used if strategy is k_fold

# Dataset configuration (inherited by all folds)
dataset:
  patch_size: 256
  patches_per_image: 20  # Full sampling for production training
  positive_ratio: 0.7
  negative_threshold: 0.05
  max_jitter: 0.25

# Model architecture (same for all folds)
model:
  architecture: unet
  encoder: resnet18
  encoder_weights: imagenet
  in_channels: 1  # Grayscale input

# Training parameters (same for all folds)

# Early stopping
early_stopping:
  enabled: true

  min_delta: 0.0001  # Minimum improvement to count as progress

# Learning rate scheduling
lr_scheduler:
  enabled: true

  factor: 0.5  # Reduce LR by half
  patience: 5  # Reduce LR if no improvement for 5 epochs
  min_lr: 0.00001  # 1e-5

# Checkpointing (per fold)
checkpointing:
  save_best: true  # Save best model by val Dice
  save_periodic: false  # Don't save periodic checkpoints to save space
  save_final: true  # Save final model after training

# TensorBoard logging (per fold)
tensorboard:
  enabled: true
  log_interval: 1  # Log metrics every epoch
  image_interval: 10  # Log sample predictions every 10 epochs
  num_image_samples: 4  # Number of validation samples to visualize

# Output configuration

  cv_dir: runs/cv_loocv  # Base directory for CV experiment
  # Individual fold outputs will be in: cv_dir/folds/fold_N/

# Validation
validation:
  prediction_threshold: 0.5  # Threshold for binarizing predictions
